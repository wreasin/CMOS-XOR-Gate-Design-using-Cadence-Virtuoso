### 2-input CMOS XOR Gate Design and Analysis with Layout using Cadence Virtuoso

---
<!-- Cadence Project (Transient, DC, AC & Noise Response With Layout) -->

Iâ€™m really glad to share that, this is my fifth project on __Cadence Virtuoso__. I am designing here a 2-input CMOS XOR Gate Design by 4 CMOS NAND Gate, with it's Layout using Cadence Virtuoso.

___Before I start explaining my project in details, you should know a few things !___     

### What is CMOS XOR Gate?  
CMOS XOR Gate (sometimes EOR or EXOR and pronounced as Exclusive OR) is a digital logic gate that gives a true (1/HIGH) output when the number of true inputs is odd. An XOR gate implements an exclusive from mathematical logic; that is, a true output results if one, and only one, of the inputs to the gate is true. If both inputs are false (0/LOW) or both are true, a false output results. XOR represents the inequality function, i.e., the output is true if the inputs are not alike otherwise the output is false. A way to remember XOR is "must have one or the other but not both".

XOR can also be viewed as addition modulo 2. As a result, XOR gates are used to implement binary addition in computers. A half adder consists of an XOR gate and an AND gate. Other uses include subtractors, comparators, and controlled inverters.

### The Project details of mine :
Here i have use __gpdk90n__ :-
1. 16T pmos1v and 16T nmos1v.
2. For vdd i have use vdc (1v)
3. For input i have use two vpulse (1v)
4. Here I am doing four types of Analysis :  
    i ) Transient Response  
    ii ) DC Response  
    iii ) AC Response  
    iv ) Noise Response & Noise Figure  
    N.B. I'm measuring here 2 inputs & output plots and Current (I) in VDD node.
5. In Layout - Metals Used ( Metal1 ) and Poly Layer
6. The minimum width of metal utilized for routing is 0.12
7. DRC and LVS clean (there are no error)

So I designed a Schematic of the CMOS XOR Gate, where the whole thing is based on gpdk90n. I have use 8 pmos for 1v and 8 nmos for 1v. I also designed a symbol of it, so that i can utilise that for further schematic creation.  

The below figure shows a 2-input CMOS XOR Gate. For Designing a XOR Gate i have use to 4 NAND Gate.

Considering all steps will show that Vout is following the expected value as in 2-input XOR Gate Truth Table.

#### DC, AC, Transient :
_Here I am doing four types of Analysis - DC, AC, Transient and Noise_.  
In DC and Transient Analysis i have measured Va, Vb & Vout as Voltage, and Current (I) in VDD node. In AC Analysis i have measured Va, Vb & Vout as Voltage Frequency and Current (I) Frequency in VDD node. For DC and Transient Analysis the plots of _Va_ , _Vb_ and _Vout_ shows the _voltages_, on the otherhand _VDD(I4)_ shows the _current (I)_. For AC Analysis the plots of _Va_ , _Vb_ and _Vout_ shows the _voltage frequency_, on the otherhand _VDD(I4)_ shows the _current (I) frequency_.

#### Noise Figure and Noise Response :  
For measuring of Noise Figure and Noise Response i had to use PORTS instead of Vpulse. For Noise Analysis i have measured input, output & VN2 noise and also Noise Figure. In Noise Response the plots shows the input, output & VN2 noise and also Noise Figure.

#### Layout :
In Layout i have use  Metal1 and Poly Layer. I have use here X & Y snap spacing is 0.01m and also the minimum width of metal utilized for routing is 0.12.

#### Design Rule Check (DRC)  
DRC is clean. There are no error in DRC.
